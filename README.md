# Roses Are Red

A relaxing video game where you play as Mother Nature &amp; fill the world with flowers.

This is my submission for the [Game Off 2022 Jam](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2022).
I participated solo, and used this jam to learn Unity's animation system as well as working with coroutines.

[Play the game on itch.io](https://tijmenmatthys.itch.io/rosesarered) or inspect the source code here.
